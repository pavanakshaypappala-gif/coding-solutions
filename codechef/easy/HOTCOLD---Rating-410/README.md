# HOTCOLD - Rating 410

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

### Is it hot or cold

Chef considers the climate `HOT` if the temperature is  **above**  $20$, otherwise he considers it `COLD`. You are given the temperature $C$, find whether the climate is `HOT` or `COLD`.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer, the temperature $C$.
### Output Format

For each test case, print on a new line whether the climate is `HOT` or `COLD`.

You may print each character of the string in either uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings `hOt`, `hot`, `Hot`, and `HOT` will all be treated as identical).

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 50$
- $0 \leq C \leq 40$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
2
21
16

```

```
HOT
COLD

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  The temperature is $21$, which is more than $20$. So, Chef considers the climate `HOT`.

 **Test case $2$:**  The temperature is $16$, which is not more than $20$. So, Chef considers the climate `COLD`.

n = int(input())
for _ in range(n):
    x = int(input())
    if(x>20):
        print("HOT")
    else:
        print("COLD")
```
